		question: "How does your adoption process work in Kenya?",
		answer: "Our adoption process is simple and hassle-free. Begin by viewing our cats online, then visit our shelter in Nairobi to meet your future companion. After finding your perfect match, we'll help you complete the adoption forms. Once approved, you can pay the adoption fee via M-PESA or bank transfer, and soon after, your new family member will be ready to go home with you! Karibu!",
	},
	{
		question: "What's included in the adoption fee?",
		answer: "Your adoption fee is a contribution towards your new friend's health and care. It covers vital services including spaying/neutering at our partner vets in Nairobi, vaccinations, microchipping, health screening, and initial veterinary check-up at local KSPCA-approved clinics. This fee helps us continue our mission of rescuing more cats from Kenyan streets and providing them with loving homes.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I adopt if I live outside Nairobi?",
		answer: "Absolutely! We welcome adopters from all counties in Kenya. While we're based in Nairobi, we can arrange meet-and-greets at our shelter or through our partner shelters in major towns. We require an in-person visit to ensure a perfect match between you and your future pet. For long-distance adoptions, we can help coordinate safe transport through our trusted pet transport partners.",
	},
	{
		question: "What support do you offer after adoption?",
		answer: "We're committed to supporting you and your new pet throughout your journey together. We provide post-adoption support including behavior advice, medical history consultation, and adjustment tips. We also connect you with our network of veterinarians across Kenya. If circumstances change and you can't keep your cat, our 'Bring Back Policy' ensures they'll always have a safe haven with us.",
