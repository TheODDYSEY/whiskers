				<h2 class="font-bold text-teal-500 h3">My Story</h2>
				<p>
					Started in 2025, my animal shelter has been dedicated to rescuing and rehoming cats in need. Over
					the years, I have grown from a small group of volunteers to a well-established organization with a
					network of foster homes and a dedicated team of staff and volunteers. My shelter provides a safe
					haven for cats of all ages, from kittens to seniors, and I work tirelessly to ensure they receive
					the care and love they deserve.
				</p>
				<h2 class="font-bold text-teal-500 h3">My Mission</h2>
				<p>
					My mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome cats in need. I believe that every cat deserves
					a chance at a happy and healthy life, and I am committed to providing the best possible care for
					my feline friends. I work closely with local communities to promote responsible pet ownership and
					to educate the public about the importance of spaying and neutering.
				</p>
				<h2 class="font-bold text-teal-500 h3">Get Involved</h2>
				<p>
					There are many ways to get involved with my shelter. Whether you are interested in adopting a cat,
					volunteering your time, or making a donation, I welcome your support. Together, we can make a
					difference in the lives of cats in need. Thank you for being a part of my community and for helping
					me to achieve my mission.
