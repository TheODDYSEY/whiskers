We're excited to introduce Luna, the newest resident at our Westlands cat shelter! Luna is a beautiful and affectionate cat who has quickly won the hearts of our staff and volunteers here in Nairobi.

## About Luna

Luna is a two-year-old African Shorthair with striking green eyes and a sleek black coat, showing the distinctive traits of our local Kenyan cats. She was found as a stray in the Kilimani area and brought to our shelter by a kind-hearted neighbor. Despite her rough start on the streets of Nairobi, Luna is incredibly friendly and loves to be around people.

## Luna's Journey

When Luna first arrived at our Westlands facility, she was a bit shy and unsure of her surroundings. With patience and care from our dedicated Kenyan team, she has blossomed into a confident and playful cat. Luna enjoys lounging in sunny spots during Nairobi's warm afternoons, chasing traditional sisal toys, and getting gentle head scratches.

## Ready for Adoption

Luna is now ready to find her forever home in Nairobi. She would do well in a calm and loving environment where she can continue to thrive. If you're looking for a loyal and loving companion to join your Kenyan household, Luna might be the perfect match for you.

## How to Adopt Luna

If you're interested in adopting Luna, please visit our Westlands shelter to meet her in person. Our adoption process includes:
1. **Visit the Shelter**: Come to our Westlands location to spend time with Luna and see if she's the right fit for your family.
2. **Application**: Complete an adoption application to help us understand your needs and preferences.
3. **Interview**: Participate in a brief interview with our local team to ensure a good match.
4. **Home Visit**: A home visit within Nairobi may be required to ensure a safe environment for Luna.
5. **Adoption Fee**: Pay the adoption fee through M-PESA or bank transfer, which helps cover the cost of Luna's care and medical expenses.
