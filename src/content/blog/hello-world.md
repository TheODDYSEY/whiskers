Karibuni to Whiskers Kenya! We're thrilled to have you here and share our passion for helping cats find their forever homes in the vibrant communities of Kenya.

## About Our Shelter

Located in Westlands, Nairobi, our shelter is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming cats in need. We specialize in caring for local breeds like the Sokoke Cat, Kenya's only indigenous breed, as well as other domestic cats found in our communities. We believe every cat deserves a loving home, and we work tirelessly to ensure they receive the care and attention they deserve.

## Adoption Process

Adopting a cat from our shelter is a straightforward process:
1. **Visit Our Shelter**: Come to our Westlands location to meet our cats and find your perfect companion.
2. **Application**: Fill out our adoption form with your details and preferences.
3. **Interview**: We'll have a friendly chat to ensure a good match.
4. **Home Visit**: For residents within Nairobi and its suburbs, we'll conduct a brief home visit.
5. **Adoption Fee**: Pay the adoption fee via M-PESA or cash, which helps cover veterinary care and shelter maintenance.

## Volunteer Opportunities

Join our community of cat lovers! We welcome volunteers from all areas of Nairobi. Opportunities include:
- Cat care and socialization at our Westlands shelter
- Weekend adoption events in various malls
- Administrative support and social media management
- Foster care program in your home
